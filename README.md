# CyberScope

CyberScope is a scalable personal project designed for learning and practicing cybersecurity. It starts with a basic **port scanner** and expands with advanced features such as **FTP honeypot**, **password manager**, and **port scanning tools**. The project allows users to interact via the terminal for a more hands-on cybersecurity experience.

## üî• Main Features

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Port Scanner**
- Scan a range of ports to detect open ones.
- Identify active services running on open ports.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Honeypot (FTP Simulation)**
- Simulated FTP server that allows any user to log in without authentication.
- Supports basic FTP commands: `ls`, `get`, `put`, and `quit`.
- Files are uploaded/downloaded in the `Files/` directory.
- Logs all activities, including login attempts and file transfers.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Password Manager**
- Stores passwords securely using encryption (Fernet from `cryptography`).
- Allows password retrieval and management.
- Generates random strong passwords.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Activity Logging & Detection**
- Logs all relevant events (connections, disconnections, commands executed).
- Detects **suspicious behavior** such as **port scans**, **rapid connections**, and **DoS attempts**.
- Saves logs in `Logs/logs.txt`.
